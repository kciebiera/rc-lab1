Todays lab contains of two parts. First on the blackboard and second in MuJoCo simulator.


# Blackboard

1. Create matrix M1 that rotates a 3D space around the x axis by 90 degrees.
2. Create matrix M2 that rotates a 3D space around the y axis by 90 degrees.
3. What is the result of M1 * M2?
4. What is the result of M2 * M1?
5. Create matrix M3 that moves a 3D space by 1 unit along the x axis and then rotates it around the y axis by 90 degrees.
6. Create matrix M4 that rotates a 3D space around the y axis by 90 degrees and then moves it by 1 unit along the x axis.
7. What is the result of M3 * M4?
8. What is the result of M4 * M3?


# MuJoCo

We are going to:
- build a car with wheels and a radar
- learn how to teleport the car to any position
- write a python program that creates a video of the car driving in a circle

## Coordinate frames

In this lab we are going to build a car with a radar. Let's start with the following XML file describing the world:


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<mujoco>
    <worldbody>
         <body name="floor" pos="0 0 -0.1">
            <geom size="2.0 2.0 0.02" rgba="0.2 0.2 0.2 1" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="x_arrow" pos="0.5 0 0">
            <geom size="0.5 0.01 0.01" rgba="1 0 0 0.5" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="y_arrow" pos="0 0.5 0">
            <geom size="0.01 0.5 0.01" rgba="0 1 0 0.5" type="box"/>
        </body>
      
    </worldbody>
</mujoco>
```

You can view the world in MuJoCo simulator. You can also install mujoco `pip install mujoco`, and run:
```
python -m mujoco.viewer
```

And you should see something like this:

![](lab_2_1.png)

Now add the third arrow (it's a box, but let's call it arrow) for the z-axis.

Note, that the length of the arrow is not 0.5 but 1. This is because (https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/XMLreference.html#body-geom) MuJoCo uses half-sizes for the box as stated in the documentation:

```
Three size parameters are required, corresponding to the half-sizes of the box along the X, Y and Z axes of the geomâ€™s frame.
```

## Car body and wheels

We have a car with two deffects:
- first, one of the wheels is not rotated correctly,
- second, car has only two wheels, but we need four.

The car XML file looks like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<mujoco>
    <worldbody>

        <body name="x_arrow" pos="0.5 0 0">
            <geom size="0.5 0.01 0.01" rgba="1 0 0 0.5" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="y_arrow" pos="0 0.5 0">
            <geom size="0.01 0.5 0.01" rgba="0 1 0 0.5" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="z_arrow" pos="0 0 0.5">
            <geom size="0.01 0.01 0.5" rgba="0 0 1 0.5" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="car" pos="0 0 0.1" axisangle="0 0 1 0">
            <geom size="0.2 0.1 0.02" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="wheel_1" pos="0.1 0.1 0.1" axisangle="1 0 0 90">
            <geom size="0.07 0.01" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="cylinder"/>
        </body>
        <body name="wheel_2" pos="-0.1 0.1 0.1" axisangle="1 0 0 0">
            <geom size="0.07 0.01" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="cylinder"/>
        </body>
    </worldbody>
</mujoco>
```

What is wrong with `wheel_2`? It is not rotated correctly. The rotation is defined by the `axisangle` attribute with four numbers:
the first three numbers are the axis of rotation, and the last number is the angle of rotation.
The axis is defined in the local coordinate frame of the body. The angle is in degrees.
You can read more about it here: https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modeling.html#corientation

Rotate the wheel so that it is parallel to the ground.

Your result should look like this:

![](lab_2_2.png)

There are only two wheels and we need four. Add the other two wheels. Experiment with different positions and rotations, change the size of the wheels.

## Radar

The last step is to add a radar to the car. The radar is a box rotated 30 degrees about x axis with a red cylinder on top. 
In its default position the radar is pointing to the right, but we want it to point in any direction.
The final result could look like this:

![](lab_2_3.png)

You can take the following XML file as a reference:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<mujoco>
    <worldbody>
        <body name="floor" pos="0 0 -0.1">
            <geom size="2.0 2.0 0.02" rgba="0.2 0.2 0.2 1" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="x_arrow" pos="0.5 0 0">
            <geom size="0.5 0.01 0.01" rgba="1 0 0 0.5" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="y_arrow" pos="0 0.5 0">
            <geom size="0.01 0.5 0.01" rgba="0 1 0 0.5" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="z_arrow" pos="0 0 0.5">
            <geom size="0.01 0.01 0.5" rgba="0 0 1 0.5" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="car" pos="0 0 0.1" axisangle="0 0 1 0">
            <geom size="0.2 0.1 0.02" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="wheel_1" pos="0.1 0.1 0.1" axisangle="1 0 0 90">
            <geom size="0.07 0.01" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="cylinder"/>
        </body>
        <body name="wheel_2" pos="-0.1 0.1 0.1" axisangle="1 0 0 90">
            <geom size="0.07 0.01" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="cylinder"/>
        </body>
        <body name="wheel_3" pos="0.1 -0.1 0.1" axisangle="1 0 0 90">
            <geom size="0.07 0.01" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="cylinder"/>
        </body>
        <body name="wheel_4" pos="-0.1 -0.1 0.1" axisangle="1 0 0 90">
            <geom size="0.07 0.01" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="cylinder"/>
        </body>
        <body name="radar_1" pos="0 -0.1 0.2" axisangle="1 0 0 30">
            <geom size="0.01 0.01 0.1" rgba="1 1 1 0.9" type="box"/>
        </body>
        <body name="radar_2" pos="0 -0.15 0.29" axisangle="1 0 0 30">
            <geom size="0.03 0.01" rgba="1 0 0 1" type="cylinder"/>
        </body>
    </worldbody>
</mujoco>
```

## Programming part 1

Write a python program, that can take four parameters:

- x position of the car
- y position of the car
- angle of the car (rotation clockwise along z axis)
- angle of the radar (rotation clockwise along z axis)

and creates the XML file for the car with the radar. The XML file should be saved as `car.xml`.

## Programming part 2

Write a python program, that creates a video of a car starting at coordinates (-3,-3) pointing to (3, -3) driving in a circle with radius 3, finishing at point (0, 0). The radar should move around the car in the opposite direction.

You can use following code as an example of video creation:


Python program creating frames:
```python
import mujoco
import matplotlib.pylab as plt


for i in range(10):
    xml = f"""
<mujoco>
  <worldbody>
    <light name="top" pos="0 0 1"/>
    <geom name="red_box" type="box" size=".2 .2 .2" rgba="1 0 0 1"/>
    <geom name="green_sphere" pos="{.2 + i / 10} .2 .2" size=".1" rgba="0 1 0 1"/>
  </worldbody>
</mujoco>
"""
    model = mujoco.MjModel.from_xml_string(xml)
    data = mujoco.MjData(model)
    renderer = mujoco.Renderer(model)

    mujoco.mj_forward(model, data)
    renderer.update_scene(data)
    plt.imsave(f"frame_{i:03d}.png", renderer.render())
```

ffmpeg command to create a video:
```
ffmpeg -framerate 3 -pattern_type glob -i 'frame*.png' -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4
```
